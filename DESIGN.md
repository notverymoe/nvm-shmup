# Design

These are just some notes I've picked up from playing and watching people play shmups. 

## General

- Hitboxes should skew in player's favor

## Bullets

- Most bullets should have some kind of directional indicator. A trail or directed shape. 
- Patterns designed for microdoging should use visually small/narrow bullets to make gaps clearer.
